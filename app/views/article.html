                <h2>What is this about?</h2>
                <p>Over the <a href="www.google.com">last few months</a>, the majority of Suicide Squad related headlines have been hogged by Jared Leto explaining all the ridiculous things he did to get into the head of the Joker.</p>
                <p>From sending a dead pig to his fellow cast members and demanding they all call him Mr. J, it sounds like the 30 Seconds to Mars singer has gone all-in with his latest role.</p>
                <p>However, as we all know, this is an ensemble film featuring numerous villains from throughout DC Comics’ history, including Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Rick Flag.</p>
                <h2>How to use it?</h2>
                <p>Also playing a part in the film is Cara Delevingne as Enchantress - while not a member of the squad, her powers have garnered the government’s attention and she partakes in the adventure.</p>

                    <code>sudo apt-get update</code>
                    <code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server;sudo apt-get install mysql-server;sudo apt-get install mysql-server;sudo apt-get install mysql-server;sudo apt-get install mysql-server;sudo apt-get install mysql-server;</code>

                <p>In a recent interview with W, the fashion model turned actress described her audition process and it sounds just as bizarre as what is going on in Leto’s head.</p>
                <p>She told the publication that she met director David Ayer on a "dark and stormy night” in which the pair discussed addiction and mental illness. On their second meeting, she was asked to read Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?<p>
                <p>"Somehow, when we were doing the scene, I became livid,” she said. "I hadn't felt rage like that in years. And then I got the part!</p>
                <p>"There still wasn't a script, but David asked me to go and try and find a forest and, if it was a full moon, get naked and walk through the woods with my feet in the mud, which I did. There wasn't a full moon, but I howled like a wolf. It would have been really funny if someone had seen me.”</p>
