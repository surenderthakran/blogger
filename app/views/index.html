                <h2>About The Author</h2>
                <p>My name is Surender Thakran.
                    I have been working with web technologies since early 2013 and managing server & code architectures since early 2014
                    so that makes me a sort of psuedo veteran in the paradigm. I have mostly been associated with small to medium sized
                    new age startups, mostly building up systems from the scratch and iteratively expanding them to scale up, which gave me a
                    substantial understanding of ins and outs of a complete product development process.</p>
                <p>I am a tech enthusiast who likes to play with all kinds of web technologies in my free time across the spectrum from frontend to
                    backend to server architectures to standalone applications. I intend this blog to be a record of my explorations with technology outside of work.
                    Soon I would be adding a number of articles and posts regarding real world implementation of different technologies and how to gel
                    them together to form a stable process chain.</p>
                <p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The project is a work in progress and is in very early stages of development.
                    You can checkout the progress on the blog on its <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/blogger" target="_blank" style="float:none; ">GitHub Repo</a>.</p>
