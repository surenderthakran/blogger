        <h2>About The Author</h2>
        <p>My name is Surender Thakran.
          I have been working with web technologies since early 2013 and
          managing server & code architectures since early 2014 so that makes me
          a sort of psuedo veteran in the paradigm. I have mostly been
          associated with small to medium sized new age startups, mostly
          building up systems from the scratch and iteratively expanding them to
          scale up.</p>
        <p>I am a full stack developer and a tech enthusiast who likes to play
          with all kinds of technologies in my free time ranging from frontend
          to backend to server architectures to standalone applications.
          Recently I got enamored with deep learning and am currently playing
          around with it. I intend this blog to be a record of my explorations
          with technologies.</p>
