<h2>Why should we Dockerize?</h2>
<p>Dockerizing an application is the process of configuring the application and
  its environment to package in a single
  <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> image and to run
  it within Docker containers.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go (GoLang)</a>
  applications (mostly) compile to a single binary, applications often depend
  on other supporting files (templates, configurations, etc). When there are a
  lot of supporting files in an application, it is common to have problems
  because of out of sync codebase. Turning your Go application into a Docker
  image is a great way to distribute & deploy your application and be assured
  that it will run on other machines exactly like it did on development
  regardless of any customizations that machine might have.</p>

<h2>How to Dockerize?</h2>
<p>Here we will learn how to Dockerize a Go web application for development as
  well as production environments. While dockerizing web applications is a
  pretty straight-forward task, there are a few challenges unique to every
  language/technology that needs to be overcome.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a simple web application which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listens for HTTP requests on a port. (let's say 18770)</li>
  <li>Handles a GET request <span class="code">/get</span> with a
    <span class="code">name</span> parameter.</li>
  <li>On receiving a request, responds back with a "Hello" message and a lucky
    number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us start by creating the requisite directory structure first. Let's name
  our project <span class="code">my_go_project</span> and have the following
  file and folder structure.</p>
<pre>
my_go_project/
      └── src/
            └── my_go_project/
                  └── main.go
</pre>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Let's have a look at
  <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/go_docker_env" target="_blank">

  Environment solution from which all team and project sizes can benefit.</p>
