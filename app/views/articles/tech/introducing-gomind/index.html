<h2>What is GoMind?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/gomind" target="_blank">GoMind</a>
  is a simplistic Neural Network library written entirely in
  <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go (GoLang)</a>.
</p>
<p>It provides educated default configuration values to simplify model creation
  and uses back propagation algorithm for training.
</p>
<p>I have <a href="/articles/tech/implement-back-propagation-neural-network"
  target="_blank">previously explained Neural Networks and back propagation
  algorithms</a> in detail. GoMind is built upon learnings from that article.
</p>
<h3>Why bother?</h3>
<p>I started learning Neural Network was an intellectual exercise and like
  almost every learning exercise it is best to set an end goal. In my case I
  decided on a two-dimensional self driving car simulation project, which I in
  my magnanimosity christened, <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/vaahan"
    target="_blank">Vaahan</a>.
</p>
<p>Over the course of the project I was forced to write my own computational
  geometry library, which I started calling <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/vaahan/tree/master/src/vaahan/gogeo"
    target="_blank">GoGeo</a>, for the of lack of any reliable library in Go like
  Python's <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">
  SymPy</a>. Hopefully some day GoGeo will also get its own repositiory but it
  has a long journey ahead of it before that happens.
</p>
<p>But I would be lying if I said that GoMind was also born because of this lack
  of good open source libraries in Go since we have <a
    href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go#machine-learning" target="_blank">
  this awesome list</a> of Go machine learning projects. No, the reason for
  starting GoMind is again educational. Afterall, what better way to understand
  neural networks than creating them yourselves (unlike simply making some API
  calls and have network models handed to you).
<h3>Why Go?</h3>
<p>I do realise that I can bypass many of my challenges if I moved away from Go
  but recently Go has been my language of choice for most of my personal
  projects because of its gentle learning curve, educated opinionatedness,
  built-in testing framework alongwith its beautiful set of tools like <a
    href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a>, <a
    href="https://golang.org/cmd/fix/" target="_blank">fix</a> etc. There is no
  dearth of material on internet listing Go's many advantages.
</p>
<p><a
  href="/articles/tech/dockerized-development-and-production-environment-golang"
  target="_blank">Combining Go with docker</a> also creates a pretty smooth
  development pipeline.

<h2>Salient Features</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<h2>Confession</h2>
<p>While GoMind is nowhere close to machine learning giants like <a
  href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Tensorflow</a> or <a
  href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a>, it
  serves it purpose as a simplistic library for quick training in Go without
  worrying about C bindings or pre-creating models in Python.
