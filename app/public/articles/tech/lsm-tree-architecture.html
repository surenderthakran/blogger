        <h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Over the past decade the modern world has become more and more data driven. 
    The amount of data generated and consumed has also exploded to an extent that 
    traditional databases are no longer the silver bullet to all use cases as they were 
    once thought to be.</p>
<p>Modern systems need storage solutions which in addition to handling varied 
    read loads can also <strong>handle large data ingestion workloads</strong> while 
    maintaining reasonable read performance.</p>
<h2>Limitations in traditional storage engines</h2>
<p>Storage engines in traditional database solutions are largely <strong>architectured 
    around B+ Trees</strong>. These provide balanced read and write performances but 
    as the data grows they start encountering performance challenges. Especially under 
    high write workloads.</p>
<p>Traditional B+ Tree based storage engines operate with the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For each write, in addition to writing row data on disk, B+ trees too have to be read, 
        rebalanced and written back to the disk. This leads to substantial 
        <strong>Write Amplification</strong> and makes database writes very compute & 
        I/O intensive operations. Under high write throughput this turns into a major 
        bottleneck.</li>
    <li>These were designed for spinning disks and <strong>provide only block level 
        addressing</strong>. Hence, to read or update even a small segment of data, 
        entire disk blocks have to be read and updated which leads to even more 
        Write Amplification.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution: LSM (Log-Structured Merge) Tree Architecture</h2>
<p>With advancements in storage technologies, storage devices have become far more 
    efficient and performant then the earlier spinning disk designs. With development of 
    SSDs and more recent NVDIMMs, we now have the capabilities of <strong>byte level 
    addressing</strong>. However, it is still not enough to handle the kind of write 
    throughputs we require. </p>
<p>One of the viable solution is to <strong>write to memory first and then persist to 
    persistent storage</strong>. This is where LSM Tree based architectures come into the 
    picture.</p>
<h2>Who uses it?</h2>
<p>LSM Tree based database storage engines have proven themselves under tremendous 
    workloads and we see a lot of database solutions built using this architecture. Some of 
    the more prominent ones are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Amazon’s Dynamodb</li>
    <li>Cassandra</li>
    <li>ScyllaDB</li>
    <li>Google’s BigTable and LevelDB</li>
    <li>Facebook’s RocksDB</li>
    <li>InfluxDB</li>
</ul>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Storage engines built on LSM Trees primarily follow two basic design ideas:</p>
<ul>
    <li>First is to <strong>write to memory first before persisting it to disk 
        asynchronously</strong>. To handle read queries on keys whose writes 
        or updates are not yet persisted to disk, the database first reads from 
        memory and fallbacks to disk only if the record is not found.</li>
    <li>Second is to <strong>treat every write as an insert</strong> i.e. append 
        writes to some data structure and post-process asynchronously to 
        merge all writes against a key into a single record. Writing in append-only 
        fashion makes writes very performant. This idea of append-only writes 
        is not new and we can find <strong>inspiration in existing Log-structured 
        file systems</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LSM Tree is not a single data structure</strong>, instead it combines 
    multiple data structures residing in different storages of a machine to efficiently 
    handle read and write workloads.</p>
<p>While dissecting the term Log-Structured Merge Tree, <strong>log-structured
    </strong> indicates that data is structured one after the other in a way similar 
    to an append-only logs. The term <strong>merge</strong> indicates the 
    techniques used to combine multiple data structures to better manage the data 
    (more on this later). Lastly, the <strong>tree</strong> indicates the storage 
    hierarchy of RAM and persistent storage used in the architecture.</p>
<p>To better understand how a database storage engine built using LSM Trees works, 
    we first need to understand the key components of the architecture.</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<h4>Memtable</h4>
<p>In an LSM Tree architecture, <strong>writes are first buffered in an in-memory 
    structure</strong> called a Memtable which provides for fast random reads and 
    sorted iteration on the data. The actual data structure used could vary across 
    database implementations. It could be something as simple as a key-value Map or 
    a much more sophisticated data structure like a balanced binary tree 
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree" target="_blank">AVL Trees</a> or 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree" target="_blank">
    Red-Black Trees</a>) or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list" target="_blank">
    Skip List</a>.</p>
<p>Data in the Memtable is flushed to a persistent storage when the size of the Memtable 
    reaches a certain threshold or when a certain amount of time has passed since the 
    last flush. When flushing, the entire data in Memtable is written to persistent storage 
    in SSTable files and the Memtable is emptied to accommodate further writes. 
    <strong>The Memtable effectively operates as a write-back cache</strong>.</p>
<h4>Write-Ahead Logs (WALs)</h4>
<p>Since the data is kept in memory in Memtables before it is flushed to persistent 
    storage, any hardware failure would result in loss of data in the Memtables. 
    To provide for tolerance against such faults, every write is also simultaneously 
    written to persistent log files. In case of failures, the database can replay the write 
    instructions from the WAL files and re-create the Memtable.</p>
<p><strong>A write is only considered successful after it has been persisted in the WAL 
    file</strong>. Since WAL files exist only in persistent storage and do not maintain 
    any in-memory buffer, writing to them is slower than writing to Memtables, effectively 
    making <strong>WAL writes the actual bottleneck for writes in LSM Tree based 
    architectures</strong>.</p>
<p>To improve write performance in WAL files, writes are only appended to the files 
    starting from the last written byte offset.</p>
<h4>SSTable</h4>
<p>SSTable is a file format which stores key-value entries from Memtable in sorted order 
    to allow quick random <strong>reads and scans in logarithmic time complexity</strong>.
</p>
<p>In LSM Tree based architectures, there can be multiple levels of SSTables ranging from 
    <span class="code">L0, L1, .. LN</span> where <span class="code">L0</span> is the first 
    level to which Memtables are flushed. Each level can have multiple SSTable files 
    partitioned by the keys they store. In some implementations, SSTables at each level are 
    <strong>also augmented with a separate Sparse index to assist in faster scans</strong>.</p>
<p>A background compactor job moves records in SSTables from newer levels to fresh 
    SSTables in older levels (more on this later). SSTables are immutable once created.</p>
<p>Since LSM Tree architecture does not update records in-place and instead operates 
    in append-only fashion, it often happens that an update to a record is still in a newer(lower) 
    level SSTable while its original write or any previous update has since been moved to a 
    higher level. Hence, <strong>a key can exist in SSTables in multiple levels</strong>.</p>
<h4>Bloom Filter</h4>
<p>Many implementations of the LSM Tree architecture also maintain a Bloom Filter for 
    every SSTable to determine if a key does not exist in the SSTable.</p>
<p><strong>A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure which when queried to check 
    if a certain value has been stored in it can answer in constant time if the value does 
    not exist or may exist in the data structure i.e. it can give false positives but never false 
    negatives.</strong></p>
<p>The probability of false positives can be controlled by configuring the size of the filter 
    and the efficacy of the hash functions used.</p>
<p>Another big advantage of using a Bloom Filter is that its size does not increase as more 
    values are stored in it (i.e. <strong>it maintains constant space complexity</strong>) 
    although the probability of false positives increases with more values.</p>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>Now we are ready to look at the workings of basic operations of a LSM Tree architecture 
    database and understand how the above components come together.</p>
<h4>Writes (Inserts, Updates and Deletes)</h4>
<p><strong>Writes to the database are simultaneously written to both a WAL file and the 
    Memtable</strong>. In case of a hardware failure, the writes in WAL are replayed from 
    the last flushed write’s offset in the file to re-create the Memtable.</p>
<p>Writes in the Memtable are flushed to a <span class="code">L0</span> SSTable file 
    once the Memtable becomes large enough or when a certain time duration has passed 
    since the last flush.</p>
<p>Deletes are also processed in append-only manner by writing a <strong>tombstone 
    entry</strong> for the key to be deleted to the Memtable instead of deleting it 
    in-place. <strong>A tombstone entry is a special record which declares that the key 
    has been deleted.</strong></p>
<h4>Compaction</h4>
<p>A background compactor job runs to perform compaction across SSTables in different 
    levels. When SSTables in two neighboring levels are being compacted, the following 
    actions are performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fresh SSTables are created in the older level by merging the SSTables in two levels. 
        For a key occurring in SSTables of both levels, the record from the newer(lower) 
        level is kept in the new SSTables.</li>
    <li>Keys with tombstone entries are not written to the final SSTables.</li>
    <li>Sparse indices and Bloom Filters are created for the final SSTables.</li>
    <li>Existing SSTables from the two levels are deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most implementations of LSM Tree use 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-way_merge_algorithm" target="_blank">k-way 
    merge algorithm</a> to merge SSTables.</p>
<h4>Reads</h4>
<p>When reading a key, it is first searched in the Memtable. If not found, the 
    <span class="code">L0</span> SSTables are consulted next. Since most LSM Tree 
    architecture implementations use Bloom Filters with their SSTables, the SSTables 
    are only scanned for the key if the Bloom Filter does not rule out the existence of 
    the key. Since the SSTables are already sorted we can search for the key using 
    binary search.</p>
<p>If either the Bloom Filter says the key is not in the SSTable or the key is not 
    found in the SSTable after scanning for it, we search in the older(higher) levels 
    until we either find the key (either with a record or its tombstone entry) or we 
    conclude that the key is not in the database since it is not in any of the levels.</p>
<p>Since the architecture requires searching in multiple data structures and files, 
    it leads to <strong>Read Amplification</strong> and makes LSM Tree 
    architecture less performant for reads then B+ Tree based database solutions.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>LSM Tree architectures are superior at handling high write workloads compared 
    to B+ Tree however suffer from relatively slower reads.</p>
<p>LSM Tree architecture is also less space efficient then B+ Tree architectures 
    since multiple versions of records can exist at multiple levels of storage and files. 
    Additionally, the compaction process is also very compute, I/O and space 
    intensive.</p>
<p><strong>B+ Tree based solutions suffer for Write Amplification while LSM Tree 
    based solutions suffer from Read and Space Amplification.</strong></p>
