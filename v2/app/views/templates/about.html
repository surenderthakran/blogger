      <p>Hey I am Surender, I am an engineer by profession and a jack of all
        trades in my free time. I am a brown belt in Karate and a semi-pro
        swimmer. I am also an avid reader (190+ books as of July 2018), fantasy
        being my favorite genre.</p>
      <h2>Profession</h2>
      <p>I have been working with web technologies since early 2013 and
        managing server & code architectures since early 2014 so that makes me
        a sort of psuedo veteran in the paradigm. I have worked with small and
        medium sized startups where I frequently built systems from the scratch
        and then iteratively expanded them to scale up.</p>
      <p>I started working with (not for) Google in 2016 and got introduced to
        some really amazing technologies and standards.</p>
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>I am a full stack developer and a tech enthusiast who likes to tinker
        with all kinds of technologies in my free time ranging from frontend
        to backend to server architectures to standalone applications.
        Recently I got enamored with neural networks and am currently playing
        around with it.</p>
      <p>I have tried to bring the coding standards used at Google in all my
        personal projects and the results have been truly amazing.</p>
      <h2>Contact Me</h2>
      <p>While I live in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India, I would
        love to hear from people all over the planet. You can find me on:</p>
