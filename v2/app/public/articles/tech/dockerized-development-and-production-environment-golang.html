        <h2>Why should we Dockerize?</h2>
<p>Dockerizing an application is the process of configuring the application and
  its environment to package in a single
  <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> image and to run
  it within Docker containers.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go (GoLang)</a>
  applications (mostly) compile to a single binary, applications often depend
  on other supporting files (templates, configurations, etc). When there are a
  lot of supporting files in an application, it is common to have problems
  because of out of sync codebase. Turning your Go application into a Docker
  image is a great way to distribute & deploy your application and be assured
  that it will run on other machines exactly like it did in development
  environment regardless of any customizations that machine might have.</p>

<h2>How to Dockerize?</h2>
<p>Here we will learn how to Dockerize a Go web application for development as
  well as production environments. While dockerizing web applications is a
  pretty straight-forward task, there are a few challenges unique to every
  language/technology that needs to be overcome.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a simple web application which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Listens for HTTP requests on a port. (let's say 18770)</li>
  <li>Handles a GET request <span class="code">/get</span> with a
    <span class="code">name</span> parameter.</li>
  <li>On receiving a request, responds back with a "Hello" message and a lucky
    number.</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="bold">Before we begin, it is imperative to have a working
  knowledge of Go (its build, test and run processes) and Docker.
  <a href="https://golang.org/doc/" target="_blank">https://golang.org/doc/</a>
  and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank">
    https://docs.docker.com/</a> can be good places to begin.</em></p>
<h3>Project Directory Structure</h3>
<p>Let us start by creating the requisite directory structure first. Let's name
  our project <span class="code">my_go_project</span> and have the following
  file and folder structure.</p>
<pre>
my_go_project/
    ├── src/
    │     └── my_go_project/
    │             ├── main.go
    │             └── main_test.go
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── Makefile
</pre>
<h3>main.go</h3>
<p>In <span class="code">main.go</span>, lets write our simple web application
  as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/get", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {

		name := r.URL.Query()["name"][0]
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %q\nYour lucky number is: %d", name, generateLuckyNumber(name))
	})

	err := http.ListenAndServe(":18770", nil) // Note: Not "localhost:18770" but ":18770"
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// Function to return a lucky number for a given name.
func generateLuckyNumber(name string) int {
	// Not really generating a lucky number here, just returning length of the string.
	return len(name)
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we have written a simple HTTP server which listens on port
  <span class="code">18770</span> for a <span class="code">/get</span> GET
  request and expects a parameter <span class="code">name</span>. We are
  generating a lucky number (not really :p) and returning it in the response
  text.</p>
<p>Note: In the above code, we are only making use of Go's internal packages.
  In the final solution, we will also be using an external package
  <a href="https://github.com/golang/glog" target="_blank">glog</a> to
  demonstrate external dependencies management.</p>
<h3>main_test.go</h3>
<p>Even the most brilliant coders are incapable of writing codes that always
  work exactly as intended. Therefore testing is an important part of the
  software development process. Test-driven development helps in keeping the
  quality of your code high and protects from regressions.</p>
<p>Let's update our <span class="code">main_test.go</span> to contain our
  test cases as follows:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-go">package main

  import (
  	"testing"
  )

  // Unit test for generateLuckyNumber() using test tables.
  func TestGenerateLuckyNumber(t *testing.T) {
  	testCases := []struct {
  		name string
  		want int
  	}{
  		{
  			name: "surender",
  			want: 8,
  		},
  		{
  			name: "thakran",
  			want: 7,
  		},
  	}
  	for _, test := range testCases {
  		result := generateLuckyNumber(test.name)

  		if result != test.want {
  			t.Errorf("generateLuckyNumber(%s) -> %d want %d", test.name, result, test.want)
  		}
  	}
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This concludes our basic web application which we will now be dockerizing.</p>
<h3>Container Directory Structure</h3>
<p>Before we continue on to dockerizing our application we need to decide on
  the directory structure we intend <em>inside</em> a docker container.</p>
<p>The following directory structure should serve our purposes.</p>
<pre>
/workspace/
    ├── src/
    │     ├── my_go_project/
    │     │        ├── main.go
    │     │        └── main_test.go
    │    ...                            // External dependencies.
    ├── bin/
    │     ├── my_go_project             // Final project binary.
    │    ...                            // Other binaries (if any).
    ├── pkg/                            // Go package objects.
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── Makefile
</pre>
<p>Note that we are placing our project in the filesystem root's
  <span class="code">/workspace</span> directory. It is a personal choice to
  use any directory you want because we usually load only one project in a
  container.
</p>
<h3>Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Every dockerized application must have a
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank">
    Dockerfile</a> which is usually located in the root of the application. A
  Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could
  call on the command line to assemble an image.</p>
<p>Let's create a Dockerfile which has the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-docker">FROM surenderthakran/go:1.7.3

MAINTAINER https://github.com/surenderthakran

ENV GOPATH /workspace
ENV PATH "$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"

COPY ./ $GOPATH

WORKDIR $GOPATH

RUN make --no-print-directory install

CMD make --no-print-directory run
</code></pre>
<p>I usually prefer to use my own base images while dockerizing my applications
  so that I have more control over what goes into my projects (just because I
  can :p). We are free to use
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/surenderthakran/go/" target="_blank">
    surenderthakran/go:1.7.3</a> or choose an
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/" target="_blank">
    Official Docker Image</a>.</p>
<p>First we need to update a couple of environment variables:
  <span class="code">$GOPATH</span> and <span class="code">$PATH</span>. We set
  our <span class="code">$GOPATH</span> as <span class="code">/workspace</span>.
  This environment variable specifies the location of our workspace and this
  where Go will look for <span class="code">/src</span>,
  <span class="code">/bin</span> and <span class="code">/pkg</span> directories.
</p>
<p>We also added our <span class="code">$GOPATH/bin</span> directory to the
  <span class="code">$PATH</span> environment variable.</p>
<p>Next we copied our project's code base to our
  <span class="code">$GOPATH</span> directory inside the container and change
  the present working directory to it. Dockerfiles best practices suggests
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy"
     target="_blank">using COPY instead of ADD</a> to move local files in a
  docker container.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">RUN</span> and <span class="code">CMD</span>
  instructions, in their simplest form, are used to build our image and to run
  our containers respectively. <span class="code">RUN</span> instruction is
  executed while building our docker image and <span class="code">CMD</span>
  instruction is executed at runtime when we launch the container.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">--no-print-directory</span> option in the
  <span class="code">make</span> commands is to prevent make from printing
  directory change messages and cluttering our log screen.</p>
<h3>Makefile</h3>
<p>I (and a lot of other developers) prefer to keep the actual image building
  and run commands out of the Dockerfile because it provides much more scripting
  liberty than using the Dockerfile. I personally prefer to use
  <span class="code">make</span>.</p>
<p>Let's update our Makefile to have the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-makefile">GO_PROJECT_NAME := my_go_project

# Go rules
go_format:
	@echo "\n....Formatting $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)'s go files...."
	gofmt -w $(GOPATH)/src/$(GO_PROJECT_NAME)

go_prep_install:
	@echo "\n....Preparing installation environment for $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)...."
	mkdir -p $(GOPATH)/bin $(GOPATH)/pkg
	go get github.com/cespare/reflex

go_dep_install:
	@echo "\n....Installing dependencies for $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)...."
	go get -t ./...

go_install:
	@echo "\n....Compiling $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)...."
	go install $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)

go_test:
	@echo "\n....Running tests for $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)...."
	go test ./src/$(GO_PROJECT_NAME)/...

go_run:
	@echo "\n....Running $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)...."
	$(GOPATH)/bin/$(GO_PROJECT_NAME)


# Project rules
install:
	$(MAKE) go_prep_install
	$(MAKE) go_dep_install
	$(MAKE) go_install

run:
ifeq ($(CODE_ENV), dev)
	reflex -r '\.go$\' -s make restart
else
	$(MAKE) go_run
endif

restart:
	@$(MAKE) go_format
	@$(MAKE) go_install
	@$(MAKE) go_test
	@$(MAKE) go_run

.PHONY: go_format go_prep_install go_dep_install go_install go_run install run restart
</code></pre>
<p>Most of what is written above should be easy to grasp for someone who has
  used Makefile's before. If you have not I strongly recommend to atleast
  skim over the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html" target="_blank">
    Official GNU Make manual</a>.</p>
<p>While creating our docker image, we first need to prepare our Go workspace
  for our application by creating the required <span class="code">/bin</span>
  and <span class="code">/pkg</span> directories in our
  <span class="code">$GOPATH</span>. Next we install all our application's
  external dependencies by running <span class="code">go get -t ./...</span>.
  With the <span class="code">-t</span> flag any separate dependencies in test
  files are also installed.
</p>
<p>Finally, we install our application by running <span class="code">
    go install $(GO_PROJECT_NAME)</span> where
  <span class="code">GO_PROJECT_NAME=my_go_project</span> as defined at the top
  of our Makefile.</p>
<p>Once our application is installed, a Go binary called
  <span class="code">$GO_PROJECT_NAME</span> is created in our application's
  <span class="code">$GOPATH/bin</span> directory which we will be using to run
  our application. Once done, a docker image is also created on the host machine
  which we can use to launch docker containers running our application. As
  defined in the Dockerfile, <span class="code">make run</span> is executed when
  a docker container is being launched which in turn executes our application's
  Go binary by running <span class="code">
    $(GOPATH)/bin/$(GO_PROJECT_NAME)</span>.</p>
<p>We now have a working production environment for our application but we also
  need to take care of our application in the development environment. We
  differentiate between development and production environment using the value
  of <span class="code">CODE_ENV</span> environment variable in the docker
  container. In a development environment its value would be
  <span class="code">dev</span>.</p>
<p>In the development environment, we need to keep track of any code changes,
  run tests on the changed code, reinstall the application and then re-run it.
</p>
<p>After a bit of research I decided on
  <a href="https://github.com/cespare/reflex" target="_blank">reflex</a> as the
  <em>current</em> best solution for monitoring file system changes and running
  reload commands for Go.</p>
<p>When a docker image is being built we also installed
  <a href="https://github.com/cespare/reflex" target="_blank">reflex</a> as a
  dependency using <span class="code">go get github.com/cespare/reflex</span>.
  When a container is launched in a development environment then on
  <span class="code">make run</span> it runs <span class="code">reflex</span>
  which recursively checks for any changes in any <span class="code">.go</span>
  files.</p>
<p>On any change in the codebase, apart from re-installing and re-running the
  application it also reformats the application's Go source files and runs tests
  using <span class="code">gofmt</span> and <span class="code">go test</span>.
</p>
<p>But there are still a few unanswered questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do the code changes occur in a docker container which is suppossed
    to be completely separated and independent of the host machine?</li>
  <li>How does an application running inside a container serve requests coming
    from outside?</li>
</ul>
<h3>docker-compose.yml</h3>
<p>Although, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/" target="_blank">
  Docker Compose</a> is a docker tool for configuring and running
  multi-container applications, it can also help us manage our development
  environment.</p>
<p>It allows us to configure applications in a <span class="code">
  docker-compose.yml</span> file usually located in the root of our project.
</p>
<p>Let's update our docker-compose.yml file to the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">version: '2'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    command: make --no-print-directory run
    volumes:
      - ./src/my_go_project:/workspace/src/my_go_project
    environment:
      CODE_ENV: dev
    ports:
      - "18770:18770"
    logging:
      driver: 'json-file'
</code></pre>
<p>We are using version 2 of the Compose file format and you can refer to
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/"
     target="_blank">
     Compose file version 2 reference</a> to grasp most of the above code. I
     would however like to draw attention to few points in the above file:</p>
<p>For a running docker container to receive code changes from  the host
  machine, we <em>mount</em> our project's Go source directory over the
  project's source directory inside the container. We do this with the
  <span class="code">volumes</span> option by specifying the mount paths like
  this: <span class="code">
    ./src/my_go_project:/workspace/src/my_go_project</span>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we differentiate between the development and
  production environments using the <span class="code">CODE_ENV</span>
  environment variable whose value is <span class="code">dev</span> in
  development environment. We can set environment variables inside docker
  container using the <span class="code">environment</span> option like we did
  above.</p>
<p>Also for our application, which runs on port <span class="code">18770</span>,
  to be accessible outside the container we need to expose the port outside the
  container and map it to an unused port on the host machine. We are free to
  choose any <em>ephemeral port</em> on the host machine. In our example, I
  choose to use the same port in container and on host machine.</p>
<h2>How to use?</h2>
<h3>In Production</h3>
<p>We can build a docker image for our go application by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker build --no-cache=true -t go_app .</code></pre>
<p>The <span class="code">--no-cache=true</span> flag askes docker to not use
  existing images from its cache while building intermediate images. Though
  docker has a pretty robust
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#leverage-build-cache"
     target="_blank">cache leveraging mechanism</a>, for sensitive production
  images it is best to be safe in case any unwanted change in previously cached
  images trickled into your final image.</p>
<p>To launch a docker container for the image created above we run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it -d --name go_app_1 --net=host go_app
</code></pre>
<p>With <span class="code">--net=host</span> the container's port
  <span class="code">18770</span> is mapped to host's port
  <span class="code">18770</span>. We can also map our application's port inside
  the container to a different port (ex: 80) by launching our container like
  this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker run -it -d --name go_app_1 -p 80:18770 go_app
</code></pre>
<h3>In Development</h3>
<p>Running our application in development is a very easy process thanks to the
  <span class="code">docker-compose</span> command. To build our application's
  docker image we run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker-compose build</code></pre>
<p>And to launch a docker container, we run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">docker-compose up</code></pre>
